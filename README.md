# Online_Conference_hall_booking_NLC_internship
This web application for booking a conference hall is an online platform for reserving the conference hall prior to the meeting in various NLCIL units across the township. It aims to provide an efficient and convenient way of reserving the conference halls for all the meetings.
It also aims to prevent issues caused by human error, which can be easily avoided by this application, like preventing conflicting reservations and booking for any date beyond a fixed period. This project also aims to be extended to a bigger scope.
